		<h1> Academics and Non- Academics </h1>
			<p><strong>Majors:</strong> My Majors is Information Technology. In first year at PCC, I was pursing Computer Science but after taking couple 
			 of classes I realized that I'm more into IT and that is how I get into this majors. I would say PCC is the best community college that as
			 a 1st year student you can take classes and decide your majors without spending too much in other colleges. Below link is provided of PCC 
			 for your assitance. </p>

			<p><strong>Sports Participation:</strong> In my High school which I completed from Pakistan , I love to participate in Volleyball, Basketball, Chess, Netball(game like Basketball), racing, and gymnastics.I even won many games we played against different schools and colleges. As a A grade student its my perspective that it is important for students to be active in both academic and non academics activities. It is also healthy life stye to be active in sports too.
